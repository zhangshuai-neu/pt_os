1.Make image file
	You can use "bximage" to create an disk image. And I have write this in 
	Makefile.

2.Test Dir
	There are several "test something" directory, which is used to show how to 
	use this module. For example, in lib dir, you can find the "test_list", 
	the code in this dir will tell you how to use "list" struct.
